      <p>If you are into Star Wars then you will want to visit Skellig Michael – and if you’re not, you should visit anyway because it is awe-inspiringly beautiful. The rocky island rises out of the Atlantic just off the Iveragh Peninsula and was frequented by ascetic monks, who chose the towering sea crag as a place to live and worship somewhere between the 6th and 8th centuries
