      <p>Set in the heart of Dublin is the iconic Guinness Storehouse. The brewery has been making Guinness here since 1769 when Arthur Guinness signed a lease for 9,000 years. Nowadays the home of Guinness is a modern visitor attraction, where fans can learn about the process of making the famous black stuff, understand the history behind it and, of course, sample it.
